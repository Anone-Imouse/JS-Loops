# JS-Loops
These are all the basic types of javascript loops that you will need as a beginner. To be honest, there is still forEach and do while loops but I feel that those things are just not as important as the ones I've put in this repository. On top of that, I don't really consider dorEach a loop since it is just giving an array all of the items an array each an attribute. It can pass functions for each of them.
